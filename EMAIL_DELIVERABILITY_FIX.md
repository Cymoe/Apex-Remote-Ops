# Email Deliverability Fix Guide

## ✅ DNS IS CORRECT - Not a DNS Issue!

Your emails show:
- SPF: PASSING (mailed-by: send.remoteops.ai)
- DKIM: PASSING (signed-by: remoteops.ai)
- Problem: Gmail's spam filter learned from past behavior

## Immediate Fixes Applied:

### 1. Changed From Address
- **OLD:** `noreply@remoteops.ai` (flagged by Gmail)
- **NEW:** `hello@remoteops.ai` (fresh reputation)

### 2. Steps to Clear Gmail's Spam Learning:

1. **Mark Current Emails as "Not Spam"**
   - Open spam folder
   - Select all RemoteOps emails
   - Click "Not spam"
   - This trains Gmail's filter

2. **Add to Contacts**
   - Add `hello@remoteops.ai` to your contacts
   - Add `support@remoteops.ai` to contacts

3. **Create a Filter (for testing)**
   ```
   From: remoteops.ai
   Action: Never send to spam
   ```

## Additional Improvements to Make:

### 1. Warm Up the Domain
- Start with low volume (10-20 emails/day)
- Gradually increase over 2 weeks
- Ask recipients to reply to emails

### 2. Improve Email Content
- Avoid spam trigger words ("exclusive", "apply now", "limited time")
- Include unsubscribe link
- Balance text-to-image ratio
- Personalize content more

### 3. Use Better From Addresses
- `hello@` instead of `noreply@`
- `welcome@` for onboarding
- `team@` for updates
- Avoid `noreply@` - it's a spam signal

### 4. Add List-Unsubscribe Header
```typescript
// In resend.emails.send():
headers: {
  'List-Unsubscribe': '<mailto:unsubscribe@remoteops.ai>',
  'List-Unsubscribe-Post': 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click'
}
```

## Testing After Changes:

1. Send test email to fresh Gmail account
2. Check if lands in inbox
3. If yes, gradually increase volume
4. Monitor Resend dashboard for bounce rates

## Long-term Solution:

Consider using a subdomain for transactional emails:
- `mail.remoteops.ai` for transactional
- `remoteops.ai` for marketing
- This isolates reputation risks

## Summary:
✅ DNS is perfect - no changes needed
✅ Changed from address to `hello@remoteops.ai`
❗ Mark existing emails as "Not Spam" in Gmail
❗ Test with new from address
❗ Gradually warm up sending volume
