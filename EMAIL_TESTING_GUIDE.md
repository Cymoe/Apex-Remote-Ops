# Email Testing Guide for RemoteOps

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Visual Testing Dashboard
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/test-emails**

This dashboard allows you to:

### 2. Required Setup

#### Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
# Resend (Required)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Beehiiv (Optional - for automation)
BEEHIIV_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Database Tables
Run the migration to create email tracking tables:
```bash
# If using Supabase locally
npx supabase db push

# Or apply directly to production
# Copy contents of supabase/migrations/20250118_add_email_tracking.sql
# to Supabase SQL editor and run
```

## üìß Email Types & Testing

```

### 2. Application Approved Email

```

### 3. Application Rejected Email

```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Email Logs in Database
```sql
-- View all sent emails
SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check specific user's emails
SELECT * FROM email_logs WHERE to_email = 'user@example.com';

-- View failed emails
SELECT * FROM email_logs WHERE status = 'failed';

-- Check email queue
SELECT * FROM email_queue WHERE status = 'pending';
```

### Verify Resend Delivery
1. Log into Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/emails
2. Check email status and delivery
3. View bounce/complaint rates

### Test Beehiiv Integration
```javascript
// Check if subscriber was added to Beehiiv
// GET https://api.beehiiv.com/v2/publications/{pub_id}/subscriptions?email=test@example.com

// Headers: Authorization: Bearer {BEEHIIV_API_KEY}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
